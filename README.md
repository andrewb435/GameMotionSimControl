 # Game Motion Sim Control #
This repo contains a rough prototype for taking motion data from a game and feeding it to a motion simulator platform. Since it's a rough prototype, it was only written to interact with Dirt Rally 2.0 over UDP and feed commands to a motion platform running SMC3 on an Arduino Uno via serial.
